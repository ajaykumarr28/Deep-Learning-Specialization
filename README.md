# Deep-Learning-Specialization

This repository contains my solutions to the programming assignments given by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) as part of their [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

1. [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://github.com/ajaykumarr28/Deep-Learning-Specialization/tree/master/1%20-%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning) - In this course, I was able to learn about the foundations of deep learning. After finishing this class, I was able to:
- Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
- Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks
- Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks
- Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture   

Week 2 - [Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset](https://github.com/ajaykumarr28/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/master/1%20-%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Logistic%20Regression%20with%20a%20Neural%20Network%20mindset.ipynb) - I built a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats. This assignment walked me through on how to do this with a Neural Network mindset, and also honed my intuitions about deep learning.

Week 3 - [Planar data classification with one hidden layer](https://github.com/ajaykumarr28/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/master/1%20-%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Planar%20data%20classification%20with%20one%20hidden%20layer.ipynb) - In this assignment, I built my first neural network, which had a single hidden layer, and I saw a big difference between this model and the one I implemented using logistic regression.

Week 4 [(i) Building your Deep Neural Network - Step by Step](https://github.com/ajaykumarr28/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/master/1%20-%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Building%20your%20Deep%20Neural%20Network%20-%20Step%20by%20Step.ipynb) - In this notebook, I implemented all the functions required to build a deep neural network.

Week 4 [(ii) Deep Neural Network - Application](https://github.com/ajaykumarr28/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/master/1%20-%20Neural%20Networks%20and%20Deep%20Learning/Deep%20Neural%20Network%20-%20Application.ipynb) - I used the functions I implemented in the previous assignment to build a deep network, and apply it to cat vs non-cat classification and saw a drastic improvement in accuracy relative to my earlier logistic regression implementation.
