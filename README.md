# Deep-Learning-Specialization

This repository contains my solutions to the programming assignments given by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) as part of their [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

- Understand industry best-practices for building deep learning applications. 
- Be able to effectively use the common neural network "tricks", including initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, Batch normalization, gradient checking,

- Understand new best-practices for the deep learning era of how to set up train/dev/test sets and analyze bias/variance
- Be able to implement a neural network in TensorFlow.
